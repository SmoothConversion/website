# Web Funnel Audit: Insert Snappy Tagline

<div class="header-divider"></div>
<div class="separator"></div>

You’ve done a bunch of work creating your online presence.  You’ve built web pages, active social media accounts, a popular blog, perhaps an email list or ten.  Now you’re finally getting some results from all that work.  It’s time to move on and focus on other things right?

Consider this:

**Not doing funnel optimization is like running a marathon and then not crossing the finish line.**

If you haven’t spent quality time looking at your funnel, or if you’ve never even thought about it until today, it’s extremely likely there is a handful of low-hanging fruit that can be captured.  Doubling and tripling current conversion percentages is often achievable 

By identifying just three choke points in their web funnel, we found over a million dollars a year that a prominent online magazine was missing out on.  That difference represented an 80% increase in their online revenue.  

**If your business has a funnel, you're likely leaving money on the table every day.**

How much can our “Funnel Optimization Audit” find for you?

* You’re an **e-commerce** business, **subscription** service, **non-profit**, **consultant**, or **freelancer** who knows that their **website** is key to accomplishing their business goals.
